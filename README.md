### Account Format (`account.txt`)
Each line should contain account information in the following format:
```
token:workerID:id:ownerAddress
```

### Proxy Format (`proxy.txt`)
Each line should contain a single proxy in the following format:
```
protocol://ip:port
```
or
```
protocol://username:password@ip:port
```

### GPU Configuration (`src/gpu.json`)
JSON array containing available GPU models:
```json
[
  "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080",
  "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090",
  "AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT"
]
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Make sure all configuration files are properly set up
2. Run the bot:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
3. Choose whether to use proxies when prompted


## 🔄 Auto-Restart (Optional)

To keep the bot running continuously, you can use this script:

```bash
chmod +x auto-restart.sh
./auto-restart.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring

The bot provides real-time information in the terminal:
- Account status and IDs
- Heartbeat confirmations
- Connection status
- Runtime statistics
- Error notifications

## 🎨 Terminal Display

The bot uses color-coded messages for different types of information:
- 🟦 Blue: System information
- 🟩 Green: Success messages
- 🟨 Yellow: Warnings and connections
- 🟥 Red: Errors and critical messages
- 🟦 Cyan: Account and session information

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. Keep your account credentials secure and never share them
2. Using proxies is recommended to avoid IP restrictions
3. Make sure your proxies are stable and fast for optimal performance
4. Monitor the bot regularly to ensure proper operation

## 📝 Logging

The bot logs all activities with timestamps and color coding:
- Connection attempts
- Heartbeat status
- Account updates
- Errors and warnings
- Runtime statistics

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify proxy settings if using proxies
   - Ensure account credentials are correct

2. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify account tokens
   - Check if tokens have expired
   - Ensure proper formatting in account.txt

3. **High CPU Usage**
   - Reduce number of concurrent connections
   - Check proxy quality
   - Increase heartbeat intervals
